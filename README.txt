Hi,

Welcome to Palera1n GUI for Mac OS!

Because this is a very early release, expect issues. Don't hate me for it,
instead just report to me a screenshot of your issue and I might help.

BEFORE STARTING. GO TO SETTINGS > PRIVACY > FULL DISK ACCESS > and make sure
You add or already have terminal added to the list!!!


How to run Palera1n app?

IF YOU GET ANY POPUPS ASKING FOR PERMISSIONS, GIVE THEM PERMISSIONS!!!

Step 1. 
cd DRAG_AND_DROP_Palera1n_GUI_folder_here

Step 2. 
Drag and Drop install_deps5.sh into your terminal and press enter.. 
Follow any popups that may come up and enter your mac password too if asked.
You then might have to press enter to continue installation. Read the 
terminal. 

Step 3. Quarantine the files AND chmod!!! This is very important otherwise it 
will break the app from working properly!

sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./palera1n

AND 

sudo chmod 755 ./palera1n


Step 4. Now in terminal enter: 

python3 palera1n.py

You can now try to use the tool and jailbreak or remove the 
jailbreak from your device. Enjoy!


NOTES:
IF YOU JAILBREAK WITH A SPECIFIC VERSION LET'S SAY PALERA1N V1.0 AND THEN
YOU DECIDE TO UPDATE TO V1.3, YOU MUST REMOVE THE JAILBREAK FROM YOUR DEVICE
AND THEN DO THE NEW JAILBREAK WITH AN UPDATED VERSION. YOU CANNOT REVERT/
REMOVE A JAILBREAK WITH A VERSION YOU NEVER STARTED THE JAILBREAK WITH. THIS
IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU RUN THE JAILBREAK, SPECIAL FILES ARE CREATED FOR YOUR DEVICE
AND THOSE ARE STORED IN THE FOLDER WHERE YOU WERE FIRST DOING THE JAILBREAK.



If the tool WORKED FOR YOU, please tweet me on twitter proof or follow me!


AGAIN THIS IS AN EARLY BUILD. DON'T SPAM ME. I HAVE TONS OF PEOPLE MESSAGING ME
ABOUT THIS TOOL OR NEEDING HELP. IF YOU'RE NOT A DEV AND YOU'RE HAVING ISSUES,
JUST LEAVE THIS ALONE AND WAIT TILL I MAKE IT BETTER.
